### About Project :

In this Project, I have made an advanced Python project on Tic Tac Toe GUI with Python. This game is very popular and is quite simple in itself. It is a two-player game. In this game, there is a board with 3×3 squares

In this game a player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, the usual games use “X” and “O”. If the first player chooses “X”, then the second player must play with “O” and vice versa.

### Game Rules :

A player marks one of the 3×3 squares with his symbol (perhaps “X” or “O”) and he aims to create a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally with two intensions:

Create a straight line before your opponent to win the game.
Prevent his opponent from creating a straight line first.
If no one can logically create a straight line with its symbol, the game ends in a tie. So there are only three possible outcomes: one player wins, his opponent (human or computer) wins, or there is a tie.
